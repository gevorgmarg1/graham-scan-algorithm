# graham-scan-algorithm
Implementation of Graham Scan Algorithm for finding the convex hull of given random point set

Using random for generating random set of points on given number n
Using matplotlib and numpy for graphing the result

The code mostly works, however, if the random generator gives 3 collinear points, it acts weird, if any solutions to this, please give advices.
